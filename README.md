# Machine Learning Project
## Kaggle-House-Price-ML

This repository is the project we do for **Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**,see information for the kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

It contains the 3 folders where raw data, processed data and submission results are stored.
The rest of files are the work where we do EDA, building and tuning models and applied interpretable ML techniques

There are 2 files containing our final coding work: ***ML_GBM-GLM-RA-EXP.ipynb*** and ***ML_EBM.ipynb***

***ML_GBM-GLM-RA-EXP.ipynb*** is where we do EDA, model comparison of GBM and GLM, and apply technique including Shapley value, partial dependence

***ML_EBM.ipynb*** is where we implement Microsoft **interpret**, mainly use `Expalanable Boosting Machine` to build a model and compare its performance to `Linear regression Model` and `Regression Tree Model`

The rest of the files shows the steps we explore data and model tuning.
