## Kaggle-House-Price-ML

This repository is the project I did for **Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**,see information for the kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

It contains the 3 folders where raw data, processed data and submission results are stored.
The rest of files are the work where I perform EDA, building and tuning models and applied interpretable ML techniques

There are 2 files containing our final coding work: ***ML_GBM-GLM-RA-EXP.ipynb*** and ***ML_EBM.ipynb***

***ML_GBM-GLM-RA-EXP.ipynb*** is where I perform EDA, model comparison of GBM and GLM, and apply technique including Shapley value, partial dependence

***ML_EBM.ipynb*** is where I implement Microsoft **interpret**, mainly use `Expalanable Boosting Machine` to build a model and compare its performance to `Linear regression Model` and `Regression Tree Model`

The rest of the files shows the steps I explore data and model tuning.
